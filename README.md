# OrderedArrayList
Generics practice with Mr. K 2020-2021

Discussion:
- How do we find the index - we can just loop through until we find the first value larger than what we want
- How do we handle overriding both add methods - just call the regular add method and ignore the index
- I was stumped on how to remove but also handle nulls at the same time - cut off
